1. Write a algorithm to look for a particular person at a party whose name you know but face you do not.
    List the name of the person you know for refernce.  
    Take into account of all the people there.
    Create a list via piece of paper.

Code for name 
   public static Person Sam = known name  ("match")
   public static Person Who is this (Person [(list of name)] room) {
                 Person known name = Sam;
                 for (for each person in room) (Person persom : room) {
                          if {person.name () = knownname() ) { return person; }
                  }
                   return null;
     }

If the person is not at the part return a null value is there is no mtach.
